I am a 2nd-year(2023 Spring-now) Ph.D student in Computer Science at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). Before this, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and my M.S degree in Computer Science at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en).


I am deeply interested in adversarial machine learning and trustworthy large language models (LLMs). My work focuses on developing innovative methodologies in adversarial learning and LLMs to ensure the robustness and reliability of AI systems. This involves creating algorithms to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks and designing frameworks to enhance the safety of LLMs. My goal is to address critical challenges in AI by making machine learning models more resilient and trustworthy in real-world applications.
